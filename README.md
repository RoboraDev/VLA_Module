## VLA-Modules: Modular Vision-Language-Action Fine-tuning for Modularized Robotics Infrastructure

A self-contained, modular system designed specifically for fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models within robotics infrastructure. 
This project provides a plug-and-play solution for adapting pre-trained VLA models to specific robot platforms and tasks.
